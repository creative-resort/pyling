# Bring Your Own Text

Place your own text here! You may borrow a text from [data/texts](../data/texts) or bring your own. Here are a few guidelines for the text that you choose: 

* any language is fine
* free of any markup or tags
* the text should be plain-text saved with a `.txt` extension. i.e. NOT Microsoft Word or equivalent, NOT rich text (`.rtf`).
* ~700kb or larger in size (i.e. a sizable corpus). This is a loose number, slightly lower is fine.
* has some kind of meta-data/introductory text at the beginning, and some indicator at the end of the file that text has ended.

A really great place to get texts like this is [Project Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org), which has a place you can download a `.txt`. You might need to right-click and select "Download Linked File As..." to download the `.txt` file directly.

If you'd prefer to simply use a ready-made plain-text file, you may pick one under [`data/texts/`](texts).
