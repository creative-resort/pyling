# Bring Your Own Text

Place your own text here! You may borrow a text from [data/texts](../data/texts) or bring your own. If you bring your own, be sure it is a plain text file with a `.txt` extension. The file should be ~700mb or larger in size (i.e. a sizable corpus). It may be in any language.

Your text should have some kind of meta-data/introductory text at the beginning, and some indicator at the end of the file that text has ended.

A really great place to get plain text resources is [Project Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org).
