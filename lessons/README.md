# Lessons

For the schedule of these lessons, see [the course schedule](../README.md#Course-Schedule)

This material is heavily derived from the Python for Text Analysis course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. To see the original context of that material, click [here](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/tree/master/Chapters). 

Chapters 1â€“11 are largely copied from the VU course, as these cover the basics. Some subsequent chapters are also borrowed, but much of the material from chapter 12-on is unique to this course. Care is taken to indicate for each notebook which material is copied or borrowed. The original license from the VU course is also included in this folder.
