# Chapters

This folder contains all the notebooks that we will use as our course material. For this course, we have divided the chapters into four blocks, each of which are closed off with an assignment:

- **`Block I`:** In this block, we will start with the very basics: you will learn about the simple but very useful built-in function `print()` and how to assign variable names to values. You will also learn what data types are, and we will start working with the numerical ones (integers and floats) and with strings. Finally, we will discuss boolean expressions and conditions (`if`-statements), where we will also introduce you to indentation and nesting.

  - [Chapter 1 - Getting Started with Variables and Values](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2001%20-%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Variables%20and%20Values.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 2 - Basic Data Types (Integers and Floats)](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2002%20-%20Basic%20Data%20Types%20(Integers%20and%20Floats).ipynb)
  - [Chapter 3 - Strings](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2003%20-%20Strings.ipynb)   
  - [Chapter 4 - Boolean Expressions and Conditions](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2004%20-%20Boolean%20Expressions%20and%20Conditions.ipynb)
  - [ASSIGNMENT 1](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Assignments/ASSIGNMENT-1.ipynb)

- **`Block II`:** In this block, we will introduce the most important containers in the Python language: **lists**, **sets**, **tuples**, and **dictionaries**. You will learn key concepts that they all share, which are positional arguments, keyword arguments, and mutability. In addition you will learn how to understand and use the methods for each container and how to use built-in functions to analyze/inspect the containers. Finally, you will learn how to loop through all the containers.

  - [Chapter 5 - Containers' core concepts.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2005%20-%20Core%20concepts%20of%20containers.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 6 - Lists.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2006%20-%20Lists.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 7 - Sets.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2007%20-%20Sets.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 8 - Comparison of lists and sets.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2008%20-%20Comparison%20of%20lists%20and%20sets.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 9 - Looping over containers.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2009%20-%20Looping%20over%20containers.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 10 - Dictionaries.ipynb](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2010%20-%20Dictionaries.ipynb)
  - [Chapter 11 - Functions and scope](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2011%20-%20Functions%20and%20scope.ipynb)

  - [ASSIGNMENT 2](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Assignments/ASSIGNMENT-2.ipynb)

- **`Block III`:** In this block you will learn how to import and use some of the most common external libraries (os, datatime, random, requests), how to create your own functions and how to combine functions and code in a Python file (.py).  We will also introduce you to reading/writing text files and doing some text processing with the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) library.

    - [Chapter 12 - Importing external modules](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2012%20-%20Importing%20external%20modules.ipynb)
    - [Chapter 13 - Working with Python files](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2013%20-%20Working%20with%20Python%20files.ipynb)
    - [Chapter 14 - Reading and writing text files](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2014%20-%20Reading%20and%20writing%20text%20files.ipynb)
    - [Chapter 15 - Off to analyzing text](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2015%20-%20Off%20to%20analyzing%20text.ipynb)
    - [ASSIGNMENT 3a](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Assignments/ASSIGNMENT-3a.ipynb)
    - [ASSIGNMENT 3b](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Assignments/ASSIGNMENT-3b.ipynb)  

- **`Block IV`:** In this block you will be introduced to three new data formats: CSV/TSV, JSON and XML.

  - [Chapter 16 - Data Formats I (CSV and TSV)](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis/blob/master/Chapters/Chapter%2016%20-%20Data%20formats%20I%20(CSV%20and%20TSV).ipynb)
